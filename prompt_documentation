### Color & Stitch Analysis Prompt

**Purpose:** Analyze the line drawing and select appropriate DMC colors and stitch types.

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze this embroidery line drawing and select DMC thread colors (2-9 colors) and embroidery stitches based primarily on the colors and visual elements present in the reference image itself.

COLOR SELECTION PRIORITY:
1. PRIMARY: Choose colors that match or complement the colors visible in the reference image
2. SECONDARY: [Brand colors if specified] (use as inspiration only if the reference image doesn't have clear color guidance)

Available DMC Colors (choose 2-9 based on the reference image):
- Black (DMC 310): #000000
- White (DMC blanc): #FFFFFF
- Dark Red (DMC 498): #A11B24

CRITICAL - You MUST select at least these 4 core stitch types:
1. Backstitch or Stem Stitch (for outlines and lettering)
2. Satin Stitch (for smooth filled areas)
3. Long-and-Short Stitch (for gradients or shaded sections)
4. French Knots or Seed Stitches (for small accents, dots, or details)

You may add additional stitches from this list:
- Backstitch: A basic outlining stitch that creates solid lines
- Running Stitch: Simple dashed line, in and out of fabric
- Satin Stitch: Parallel straight stitches that fill areas smoothly
- French Knot: Small raised knots for texture and detail
- Chain Stitch: Linked loops forming a chain-like line
- Stem Stitch: Rope-like stitch perfect for stems and outlines
- Split Stitch: Similar to backstitch but softer, splits previous stitch
- Lazy Daisy: Single chain stitch forming petal shapes
- Straight Stitch: Single straight stitch for grass, rays, or short lines
- Blanket Stitch: Decorative edge stitch with loops

Consider:
1. Analyze the colors present in the reference image and choose DMC colors that match those
2. If brand colors are specified, use them as secondary inspiration but prioritize the reference image colors
3. Use minimum 2 colors, maximum 9 colors
4. All 4 core stitch types must be included and clearly visible
5. Additional decorative stitches (lazy daisy, chain stitch, fly stitch) are optional

Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "colors": ["Color Name (DMC code)", "Color Name (DMC code)", ...],
  "stitches": ["Backstitch", "Satin Stitch", "Long-and-Short Stitch", "French Knots", ...],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your choices, specifically noting which colors from the reference image you matched"
}

### Hero Image Prompt (Main Product Photo)

**Purpose:** Generate the main polished product photo - finished embroidery in hoop.

**Prompt:**
```
A realistic, photorealistic hand-stitched embroidery of [SUBJECT] displayed in a light wood embroidery hoop (6-8 inches) on neutral linen or cotton fabric (white, cream, or natural beige).

[ADDITIONAL USER INSTRUCTIONS IF PROVIDED]
[BRAND VISUAL AESTHETIC GUIDANCE IF PROVIDED]

Thread Colors ([SELECTED COLORS]) - all threads coordinate with the brand's color palette and use 2-9 total colors from the brand palette.

Stitch Types - The embroidery MUST show at least these 4 distinct, clearly visible stitch types:
1. Backstitch or Stem Stitch for outlines and any text/lettering
2. Satin Stitch for smooth filled areas with visible thread sheen
3. Long-and-Short Stitch for gradients or shaded sections blending colors
4. French Knots for fine dots, accents, or sparkle details

Additional stitches used: [SELECTED STITCHES]

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Warm, natural lighting with soft shadows and gentle highlights emphasizing thread texture
- Fabric weave clearly visible in background
- Thread must show realistic sheen, subtle imperfections, and authentic stitch direction changes
- Light wooden hoop with visible grain
- Handmade quality - not perfect, but beautifully crafted
- This is the polished, Etsy-ready hero product photo
- All stitches should be clearly distinguishable and realistic

REALISTIC FABRIC MARGIN (CRITICAL):
- Leave 0.5-1 inch (12-25mm) of empty fabric space between the outer edge of the embroidery design and the inner edge of the wooden hoop
- This margin is ESSENTIAL for authentic hand embroidery - you cannot stitch right up to the hoop edge in real embroidery
- The design (including any text/lettering) must be comfortably centered with visible breathing room all around
- If the embroidery has text or border elements, they must stay well within the fabric area, not crowding the hoop
- The hoop should frame the design with natural spacing, not appear to be cutting it off

AUTHENTIC HAND-STITCHED TEXT/LETTERING REQUIREMENTS (if text is present):
Text must look authentically hand-embroidered, NOT computer-generated fonts. Follow these characteristics:

1. STITCH TECHNIQUE:
   - Use backstitch or stem stitch for all lettering
   - Each letter formed by individual visible stitches, not solid lines
   - Stitch length varies naturally (1-3mm typical range with organic variation)
   - Stitches follow letter curves with natural hand movement

2. ORGANIC IMPERFECTIONS (essential for authenticity):
   - Letters have slight wobbles and irregularities - not machine-perfect
   - Letter height varies subtly (within 5-10% natural variation)
   - Baseline has gentle organic waves, not laser-straight
   - Curves in letters (O, C, S) show natural hand-stitched flow with visible stitch changes
   - No perfectly straight lines - everything has subtle natural curves

3. LETTER CHARACTERISTICS:
   - Letter spacing has organic variation (not perfectly uniform like fonts)
   - Letter width naturally varies based on hand-stitching
   - Crossbars and horizontal strokes show individual stitch segments
   - Letter connections (in script) show natural thread flow with visible entry/exit points

4. VISUAL TEXTURE:
   - Individual stitches clearly visible - not blended into solid shapes
   - Thread has dimension and depth from varying tension
   - Slight gaps between stitches create authentic handmade appearance
   - Thread catches light differently along each stitch creating natural variation

5. WHAT TO AVOID:
   - DO NOT create perfect, uniform font-like letters
   - DO NOT make letters look digitally printed or computer-generated
   - DO NOT use satin stitch fill for letters (unless specifically in reference)
   - DO NOT create perfectly smooth, vectorized letter shapes
   - Text should never look like typography - it must look hand-stitched

6. REFERENCE AUTHENTIC HAND EMBROIDERY:
   - Study real backstitch embroidery lettering examples
   - Letters should look like someone patiently stitched each one by hand
   - Embrace the beautiful imperfections of handcraft
   - Think vintage sampler aesthetics, not modern screen printing

DO NOT ADD TEXT, TITLES, OR WORDS TO THE EMBROIDERY unless they appear in the line drawing reference image. Strictly follow the approved line drawing design without adding extra text elements.

### 1. SEO ALGORITHM BOOST

  • handmade gift for adults
  • modern hand embroidery
  • diy craft therapy
- **Rotate synonyms and natural phrasing** — NO keyword stuffing or repetition
- **Include BOTH seasonal AND evergreen keywords** in every listing:

  • Evergreen: Funny Embroidery, PDF Pattern, Digital Download

### 2. PERFORMANCE PRIORITY RANKING
When balancing brand tone vs. algorithm rules, follow this order:
1. **Clarity of what the product is** (most important)
2. **Keyword positioning** (first 150 words)
3. **Tone and humor**
4. **Length and readability**
5. **Meta consistency** (tags, title, description alignment)

### 3. TONE CONTROL RULES

- Etsy scans for **literal product words first**
- Humor should **wrap around searchable phrases**, NOT replace them
- ✅ GOOD: "This Christmas embroidery pattern delivers festive chaos in thread form."

- Keep humor sharp but accessible
- Avoid deep internet in-jokes that may lower discoverability

## Recent Updates Summary

### Mockup Generation Updates

#### ✅ Realistic Fabric Margin Requirements (Latest Update)
**Problem:** Embroidery designs were appearing too close to hoop edges, looking unrealistic  
**Solution:** Added explicit margin requirements to all mockup prompts:
- 0.5-1 inch (12-25mm) empty fabric space between design and hoop edge
- Emphasized this is ESSENTIAL for authentic hand embroidery
- Applied to: Hero image, detail close-up, in-progress, styled display, flat lay, marketing photo

#### ✅ Hand-Stitched Text Authenticity Guidelines
**Problem:** Text in mockups looked computer-generated and font-like, not hand-stitched  
**Solution:** Added comprehensive text authenticity requirements:
- Individual visible stitches (backstitch/stem stitch)
- Natural irregularities and organic spacing
- Visible stitch length variation (1-3mm)
- Thread dimension and texture
- Explicit instructions on what to avoid (perfect uniform fonts, digital appearance)
- Applied to: Hero image, detail close-up, in-progress, styled display

#### ✅ Pattern Protection for Flat Lay
**Problem:** Pattern was fully visible in listing photos, allowing copying  
**Solution:** Added pattern obscuring instructions:
- Pattern sheet must be PARTIALLY OBSCURED by hoop, fabric, or tools
- Key parts hidden under other items in the flat lay
- Pattern paper visible but actual line drawing mostly covered or angled
- Protects digital product from being replicated from listing photos

#### ✅ No Unwanted Text Addition
**Problem:** AI was adding project titles or text to mockups not in original design  
**Solution:** Added explicit instructions to all 7 mockup variations:
- "DO NOT ADD TEXT, TITLES, OR WORDS TO THE EMBROIDERY unless they appear in the line drawing reference image"
- "Strictly follow the approved line drawing design without adding extra text elements"
- For marketing photo: Clarified text overlays are OUTSIDE embroidery area only

**Features:**

3. **Skill Level (CRITICAL):** ALWAYS include "perfect for beginner to intermediate stitchers" (matches Etsy filters)
